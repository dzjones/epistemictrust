Apologies for the state of this codebase.

Pre-trained models (incl. the random forests) are available in the "`models-2023-04-10-2229.pkl`" file. You'll need cuML to run them. You'll find an example of how to use them in the "`clsp`" function in `02-modelling.py`.

Basically: you'll need the `msmarco-distilbert-base-v4` sentence transformer, the models, and some sentences.
